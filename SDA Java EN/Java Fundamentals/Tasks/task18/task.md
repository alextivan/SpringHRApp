Write a program that encrypts a given string using the Caesar cipher, which is a special case of a mono-alphabetic substitution cipher. The program retrieves the text to be encrypted from the user and the number n by which the alphabet is moved by which the text is encrypted, and then prints the encrypted text in the console. For simplicity, it can be assumed that the input string consists only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, i.e. `'a' - 'z'` and spaces.

* Example a: text: `"ala has a cat"`, n: `1`, result: `"bmb ibt b dbu"`

* Example b: text: `"ala has a cat"`, n: `26`, result: `"ala has a cat"`

Get the data from the user in the console using the `Scanner` class.
