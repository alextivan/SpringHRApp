Write a program that, based on the variable: `income (double)`, will calculate the amount of personal income tax due and write it to the console.

The tax is calculated according to the following rules:
* up to 85,528.00 tax is 18% of the base minus 556.02,
* from 85,528.00 tax is 14,839.02 + 32% of the surplus over 85,528.00.

Get the income from the user in the console using the `Scanner` class.
