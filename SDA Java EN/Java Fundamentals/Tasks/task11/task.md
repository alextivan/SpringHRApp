Write a program that takes an integer greater than 1 from the user and checks if the number is a prime number. In the case when this number is a prime number, the program will write a message `"Yes"` in the console, otherwise it will write a message `"No"` in the console.

If the user gives a number less than or equal to 1, the program will write in the console the message: `"I am interrupting work"`
Â 
Get the data from the user in the console using the `Scanner` class.
