Write a program that based on the variable temperature in degrees Celsius - `tempInCelsius (float)`, will calculate the temperature in degrees Farhenheit (degrees Fahrenheit = 1.8 * degrees Celsius + 32.0) and write it in the console.

Get the temperature from the user in the console using the `Scanner` class.
