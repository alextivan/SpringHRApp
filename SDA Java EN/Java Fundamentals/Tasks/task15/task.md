Write a program that reads the text entered by the user and then divides it into individual words. Then counts the number of occurrences of words regardless of case and writes them to the console in alphabetical order.

For example, for the text `"Ala likes cats, but she is not liked by the Cats."`, the program should write in the console:

* ala - 1
* but - 1
* by - 1
* cats - 2
* is - 1
* liked - 1
* likes - 1
* not - 1
* she - 1
* the - 1

Assume that any punctuation marks may appear in the text.

Get the data from the user in the console using the `Scanner` class.
