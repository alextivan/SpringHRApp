Write a program that takes from the user two integers A - `a (int)` and B - `b (int)`, where `A <B`, and then calculates the sum of the sequence of numbers from A to B (A, A + 1, A + 2, ..., B) and prints it in the console. When the `A <B` condition is not met, the program exits by writing `"Job completed"` in the console.

For example, for A = 4 and B = 11, the program should write the number 60 in the console.

Get the data from the user in the console using the `Scanner` class.
