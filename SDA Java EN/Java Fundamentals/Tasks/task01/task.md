Write a program that, based on the variables: height - `height (int)` and weight - `weight (float)`, checks whether a person can ride a roller coaster.

If a person is taller than 150cm and does not exceed 180kg, the program will write in the console `"Fasten your seatbelt!"`, Otherwise it will write in the console `"I'm sorry you can't go!"`.

Get the data from the user in the console using the `Scanner` class.
