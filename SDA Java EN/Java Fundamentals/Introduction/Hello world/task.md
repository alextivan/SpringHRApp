## Introduction to IntelliJ EduTools

IntelliJ EduTools is a great tool that is ideal for learning programming in ** Java ** in the form of homework.

The repository you have downloaded refers to a specific module in the course you are a student. It is worth noting that this repository has been divided into lessons, where each lesson has one or several tasks.

Tasks can be divided into several categories:
* ** Theoretical ** - present and discuss theoretical issues. In this type of tasks you do not write code but learn or repeat various issues. It may happen that you will be presented with a ready program. To see its effects, click the `Run` button.

* ** Verification ** - verify your theoretical knowledge using simple tests.

* ** Practical ** - require a solution to the task presented. They can provide some already written code and require you to complete the program to achieve the expected result. They can also expect to write the entire program from scratch. Your solutions are always verified for correctness and the task is passed only if the program behaves as it was presented in the requirements of the task. You can also preview the solution. After all, try to solve the problems yourself and do not use this option.


To check if the solution of the task or answer in the test is correct, click on the `Check` button. If all went well, you can go to the next task by clicking the `Next` button.
