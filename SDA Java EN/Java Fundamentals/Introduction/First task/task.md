## Hello World

All outstanding programmers began their programming adventure by writing the program "Hello world".

The goal of the program is to display the text `Hello world` and then exit. It is the simplest possible program that can be written in any programming language.

In Java, the `System.out.println` command is used to display text on the screen. Enter the text to be displayed on the screen in brackets.

Text in Java should always be given in quotation marks (`""`), e.g. `"Some text"` or `"Anything"`.

Saving the following program:

```java
public class Task {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        System.out.println("Some text");
    }
}
```

and running with the `Run` command (green triangle in the upper right corner) will display the following result:

```text
Some text
```

Armed with this knowledge, write your first program that will print the text `"Hello world"` on the screen. Run it to check if it works properly. When you are sure it is ok, press the `Check` button below.

If the program works correctly, press the `Next` button to go to the appropriate section for the given course module.
