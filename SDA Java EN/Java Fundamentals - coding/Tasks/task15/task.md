Write an application, that will read two positive numbers (type `int`) and will return a remainder after division
of the bigger number by smaller number. 

**Warning!** To make it harder, **your application MUST NOT use neither modulo operation (`%`) nor division (`/`)**.

<div class="hint">
You can calculate remainder by substracting smaller number from bigger number until the next subtraction
would give negative result. 

For example, to find a remainder after division of 24 by 7, you should subtract 7 from 24 three times
 (24 % 7 = 24 - 3*7 = 24 - 21 = 3)
