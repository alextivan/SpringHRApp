Write an application, that will calculate speed in kilometers per hour (km/h) equal to given speed in miles per hour (mph). Your application should read one variable from user (of type `float`) and calculate speed, using following formula:

`speed in km/h = 1.6 * speed in mph`

You should read input from user using `Scanner` class.
