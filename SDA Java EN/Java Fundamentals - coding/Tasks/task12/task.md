Write an application that will read text and "bleep" swear words. Found swear words should be replaced 
with `[bleep]`. You can assume that swear words will be all lower case.

Swear words are: `cheese and rice`, `chuck it`, `motherpuffin`.

---

For example, text:
`It's not compiling again, cheese and rice!`

Should be replaced with:
`It's not compiling again, [bleep]!`
