Write an application, that will read text (type `String`) and will upper-case letters in last three characters of text. If text is shorter than three characters, your application should upper-case all letters.

Examples:
* `Lorem ipsum` -> `Lorem ipSUM`
* `Lorem ipsum:)` -> `Lorem ipsuM:)`
* `ok` -> `OK`
