Write an application that will read text (type `String`) and check if given text is a palindrome. Your application should print `true` or `false`.

Palindrome is a text, that reads the same backwards as forwards. It is case-insensitive (doesn't matter if letter is lowercase or uppercase) and ignores spaces.

Example of palindrome: `Never odd or even`.
