Write an application, that will read a number (of type `int`) and will write in one line all numbers starting from given number to 0 (included). Keep in mind that given number may be equal to 0 or be negative.

Examples:
* for given number: `5`, application should write: `5 4 3 2 1 0`
* for given number: `0`, application should write: `0`
* for given number: `-4`, application should write: `-4 -3 -2 -1 0`
