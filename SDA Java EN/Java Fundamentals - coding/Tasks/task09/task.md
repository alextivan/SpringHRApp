Write an application, that will draw Christmas tree according to examples below. The height of the tree should be read from user (positive integer). 

Examples: 

Tree with height=3:
```  
  *
 ***
*****
  #
```

Tree with height=4:
```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
   #
```

Your code should print a tree for any proper height given. Your application should generate the tree using single characters - it must not return tree copy-pasted by you!

<div class="hint">
To center the tree you can put spaces on the left side of the tree.
</div>
