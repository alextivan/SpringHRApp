Write an application, that:
1) will read start number `x` (type `int`)
2) will read end number `y` (type `int`)
3) will check if start number is no bigger than end number and if both numbers are in range from `0` 
(included) to `10 000` (included). If not, your application will quit, without printing anything.
4) will write all integers divisible by `7` in given range (from `x` (included) to `y` (included)).
