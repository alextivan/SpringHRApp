Write an application, that will read two times five numbers (ten variables of type `int`) and print only those,
which occured both in first and second five-element set of input.
For simplicity, you can assume that numbers will not repeat within one five-element set.

<div class="hint">
You can use arrays, one- or two-dimensional.
